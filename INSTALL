Installation
------------

REQUIRES perl Net::DNS module:
Debian Based: apt-get install libnet-dns-perl
RedHat Based: yum install perl-Net-DNS

INSTALLING
There's nothing special you should do in order to install hostupd, you can just
untar it and use the script. Make sure that the perl module (hostupd_conf.pm)
is found in the same directory of the perl script itself.
You can use 'make install' to put everything in /usr/local (modify the Makefile
for some other prefix..)



CONFIGURING BIND FOR DYNAMIC UPDATES
Your dns daemon should be properly-configured to allow hostupd to send
updates. So far I've only used bind- if you can send me instructions for
another dns daemon configuration I'll be glad to add them here.
Anyway, This is how I configured my bind to allow updates (named.conf):

1. I defined an acl- a group of trusted IPs which can update my dns:
---
acl "updaters" {
        127.0.0.1;
        192.168.0.1;
};
---

2. Added an 'allow-update' phrase to my zone settings. here're my zone
settings:
---
zone "foo.bar" in {
        type master;
        file "foo.bar.zone";
        allow-update { updaters; };
};
---

Some notes:
1. You can skip step 1, and specify the list of IPs inside the 'allow-update'
line. I think it's more messy though, especially if you have more than one
zone.

2. The zone type must be 'master' when using the 'allow-update' phrase. It even
makes sense if you'll think about it.

3. It's not too secure to allow a specific IP to send updates, without any
additional checks. That's why bind added an option to use a key (shared secret)
for authentication- unfortunately hostupd doesn't support it yet.
