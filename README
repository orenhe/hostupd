Hostupd
-------

WHAT IS HOSTUPD?
hostupd is a command-line tool which allows the user to update a dns server
which supports dynamic updates (rfc2136), such as bind >= 8. Its main goal
is to simplify the dns-updating task, but to remain flexible.


FEATURES
Hostupd actually does what bind's nsupdate does, but contains additional
features which hopefully will make your life easier:
- Fast deletion of all the records of some type with a simple command
  (hostupd del domainname).
- Makes sure that your change was indeed commited, and lets you know if it
  wasn't.
- Friendly commands (hostupd add domainname 192.168.0.1).
- Simple updates (hostupd add domainname 192.168.0.2 -u).
- Automatically updates the PTR records when adding an A record, unless
  disabled.
and some more..


REQUIREMENTS
Hostupd was tested with bind 9, but should work with any dns server which
implements the Dynamic DNS rfc well. Also, a perl with Net::DNS module is 
needed. Get it from cpan.org.


INSTALLATION
